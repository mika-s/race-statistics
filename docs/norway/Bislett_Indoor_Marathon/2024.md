#### Statistics

Finishes better than 0:25 and worse than 1:30 are filtered out. Results faster than 0:25 are due to
faulty data (e.g. DNFs) and results worse than 1:30 makes the distribution plots hard to read, as the entire
distribution gets shifted left.

Finishes without a registered category are also filtered out.
