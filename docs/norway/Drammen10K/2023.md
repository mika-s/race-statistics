# Drammen10K - 2023

Distances: 5 km and 10 km

### 5 km

- Type: Road race, only on asphalt

#### Statistics

Finishes better than 0:12:00 and worse than 0:40:00 are filtered out. Results faster than 0:12:00 are due to
faulty data (e.g. DNFs) and results worse than 0:40:00 makes the distribution plots hard to read, as the entire
distribution gets shifted left.
