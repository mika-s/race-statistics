# Nydalsløpet - 2023

Distances: 3 km and 5 km

### 3 km

- Type: Road race, partially on gravel

#### Statistics

Finishes better than 6 minutes and worse than 35 minutes are filtered out. Results faster than 6 minutes are due to
faulty data (e.g. DNFs) and results worse than 35 minutes makes the distribution plots hard to read, as the entire
distribution gets shifted left.
