#### Statistics

Finishes better than 0:12:00 and worse than 0:40:00 are filtered out. Results faster than 0:12:00 are due to
faulty data (e.g. DNFs) and results worse than 0:40:00 makes the distribution plots hard to read, as the entire
distribution gets shifted left.

The values in the table are based on chip times. The reported finish times on the official race website are gun times
so there are some deviations between them.
